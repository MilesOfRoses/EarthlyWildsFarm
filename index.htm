	<h2>Earthly Wilds Farm is a small off grid market garden that practices regenerative farming practives to produce naturally grown vegetables, free from any toxic chemical sprays of pesticides or herbicides</h2>

	<p id="about">Earthly Wilds Farm is a new market garden enterprise located in Torch Lake Michigan, 
		owned and operated by me, <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/an-introduction">Miles Rose!</a> I have been an avid gardener for over a 
		decade, and I am excited to turn my passion into a business!  
		Right now, I am focusing on growing, greens (Red and Green Lettuce, Baby Red Kale, Arugula, Spinach, Etc.), Garlic, as well as roots like Turnips and Radishes. My farm is Off-The-Grid, it is not 
		connected to any electric lines, gas lines, or water lines. I primarily generate what 
		little electricity I need using <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/basic-400-watt-solar-off-grid-system">solar panels.</a> I always try to find creative ways to get 
		the most use out of a small amount of energy, treading lightly on the earth while 
		still having a positive impact! I farm using <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/what-is-regenerative-agriculture">natural regenerative practices</a> that 
		respect the earth, soil, life and wild ecology. My farming methods are free from any 
		toxic synthetic chemical pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, etc. I'm excited to feed as many people in the local community as I can, with the most healthy, natural, nutrient dense food that I can grow!
