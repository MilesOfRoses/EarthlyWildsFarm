	<h2>A small off-grid regenerative market garden</h2>

	<p id="about">Earthly Wilds Farm is a new market garden enterprise located in Torch Lake Michigan, 
		owned and operated by me, <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/an-introduction">Miles Rose!</a> The land that my farm is loacted on is owned by a non-profit called The Chalfonte Foundation.
		I grow baby greens (Arugula, Spinach, Kale, Red and Green Lettuce, etc.) as well as Garlic, Turnips, Radishes and Carrots. My farm is Off-The-Grid, it is not 
		connected to any electric, gas, or water lines. I primarily generate what 
		little electricity I need using <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/basic-400-watt-solar-off-grid-system">solar panels.</a>  I farm using <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/what-is-regenerative-agriculture">natural regenerative practices</a> that 
		respect the earth, soil, life and wild ecology. My farming methods are free from any 
		toxic synthetic chemical pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, etc. I'm excited to feed as many people in the local community as I can, with the most healthy, natural, nutrient dense food that I can grow!
